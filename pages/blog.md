First step in this tutorial is to make an account at <https://github.com/> as it will be used for your Netlify account as well. So go ahead and do this.

Go ahead and sign up and link your github to your netlify by following the buttons.

Lets start by now going to <https://templates.netlify.com/tags/jekyll/> and pick a theme. I'm going for this one at the bottom. Then just click on Deploy to netlify and well move on.

This is going to create a **Repository** on your Github, so go ahead and click to move forward!

You can now rename this repository if you would like (i'm going to use the default) and then Save and Deploy!

Now go ahead and grab a coffee and wait for Netlify to upload this website! once it's done you can click on the link it generates and take a look at your site!

Now go the the search bar up top and add **/admin** and that will allow you to begin editing your site! but we're not done yet! lets take a few steps back!

So lets say you made your own website! wow you're really talented my friend! So..how do you upload it? well go and install Github Desktop to make this easy. Once it's installed you can simply open it up, grab the folder with your website, and drop it into the app! it will prompt you to create a repository instead, do so, and then push it to git hub, and make it public!

Now head back to netlify and get ready to upload your website by clicking on New site from Git

Select git hub and move forward!

Ignore my big list of projects and junk, but yours should be must shorter if it's your first time. Select the file name you made and it will begin the launch!

Make sure the Branch to Deploy is set to **Master** and then deploy site!

Maybe don't get another coffee so soon, but just wait out the upload. This may take a while depending on the file size!
